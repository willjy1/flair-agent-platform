# Target Market Research (Internal) - 2026-02-26

This is for internal sales strategy only. Do **not** include other companies in Flair-specific materials.

## Summary

The strongest expansion targets for this platform are:

1. ULCC / low-cost airlines (very close to Flair workflow shape)
2. Intercity bus operators (similar disruption/change/refund support patterns)
3. Ferry/passenger transport operators (weather disruption + schedule-change support)

## Why This Platform Is A Strong Fit

This platform is strongest where customer support demand is dominated by:

- disruptions and schedule changes
- booking changes/cancellations
- refunds/credits
- baggage/lost property intake
- accessibility support
- fragmented support channels (phone, forms, help centre, chat, social)

These are exactly the pain patterns common in low-cost travel operators.

## Who Is Most Likely To Buy First (Practical Sales Reality)

Most likely early adopters (faster cycle, high pain):

1. Smaller low-cost airlines / regional carriers
2. Intercity bus operators
3. Ferry operators with heavy weather disruption burden

Harder but higher-value later targets:

1. Larger network airlines (longer procurement, heavier integration/security demands)
2. Large rail operators (often slower procurement/government procurement complexity)

## Why This Is Likely Profitable For You

The product is becoming reusable across a narrow but lucrative set of travel-support workflows.

Profitability drivers:

- Reusable core orchestrator + specialist agent architecture
- Tenant profile configuration instead of full rebuilds
- Reusable channel handlers (web/sms/voice/email/social)
- Repeatable support workflow patterns across transport operators
- Ability to sell modules:
  - core support agent
  - voice
  - proactive disruption outreach
  - analytics/ops dashboard
  - compliance tooling

## Suggested Outreach Sequence

1. Land a strong Flair pilot / proof point first
2. Build 1-2 adjacent airline demos using tenant profiles (private, not customer-facing)
3. Pitch one bus operator to prove cross-vertical reuse
4. Productize onboarding playbooks by vertical (airline, bus, ferry)

## Notes / Caveats

- Public review pages are directional signals, not definitive performance metrics.
- Buying willingness depends on procurement, IT constraints, and leadership priorities.
- Public contact pages do not prove internal tooling quality; they only show the visible channel model.
