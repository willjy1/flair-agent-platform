# Targets To Sell Next (Internal Expansion List)

This file is for internal business development planning only. Do not use it in Flair-specific pitch materials.

## What Makes A Good Target For This Platform

Best-fit businesses have:

- high support volume
- frequent disruptions or schedule changes
- refund/change pressure
- fragmented support across phone/chat/forms/help-centre/social
- strong need for context continuity and faster resolution
- enough volume to justify platform spend and ROI

## Best Next Targets (Airlines + Similar Travel Businesses)

### Tier 1: Low-Cost / Ultra-Low-Cost Airlines (Most Similar To Flair)

These are closest to the current build and likely fastest to adapt.

- Frontier Airlines (US ULCC)
- Spirit Airlines (US ULCC)
- Allegiant Air (US low-cost leisure airline)
- Volaris (Mexico ULCC)

Why they fit:

- Similar disruption/change/refund/baggage/accessibility support patterns
- High customer support pressure relative to ticket price
- Strong need for automation + handoff quality + self-service routing
- Easy product adaptation from current airline-specific flows

### Tier 2: Intercity Bus Operators (Very Similar Problem Shape)

- FlixBus (regional variants/markets)
- Megabus

Why they fit:

- Delay/disruption/change/refund flows are very similar to airlines
- Large volume of repetitive support inquiries
- Multi-channel support fragmentation is common
- Lower integration complexity than airlines in many cases

### Tier 3: Ferry / Passenger Transport Operators

Examples to evaluate:

- regional ferry operators with weather disruptions, schedule changes, and accessibility demand

Why they fit:

- Similar operational disruption patterns (weather, cancellations)
- High need for clear next-step guidance and multi-channel continuity
- Often weaker digital support stacks than larger airlines

## Why This Is Likely Profitable (For You)

- Same core orchestration engine reused across tenants
- Most customization can be done through:
  - tenant profile config
  - knowledge snapshot
  - adapter integrations
- Revenue model can combine:
  - setup fee
  - monthly platform fee
  - usage fee (conversation / resolution / channel)
  - premium modules (voice, proactive disruption, analytics)

## Public Research Signals (Current, Directional)

These businesses/public channels are worth targeting because they show combinations of:

- official multi-channel support systems
- large travel support volume
- customer review signals indicating service pain points

Examples of sources used:

- Official support/contact pages (company websites / help centres)
- Public help-centre channel documentation
- Third-party review platforms (Trustpilot) as directional customer pain signals

## Sales Approach Recommendation

Start with a Flair-specific deployment and use it as the proof of value.

Then target:

1. ULCC / low-cost airlines in North America
2. Intercity bus operators
3. Regional ferry operators

Lead with:

- fewer repeated contacts
- faster resolution
- better disruption handling
- better handoff quality
- customer-visible trust improvements (official sources embedded in support flow)
