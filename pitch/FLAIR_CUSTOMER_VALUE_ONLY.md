# Flair Support Agents - Customer-Facing Value (Flair-Only)

## What Customers Get That Is Better Than A Typical Fragmented Support Experience

- One conversation for support instead of hopping between pages, forms, and channels
- Text and voice support in the same experience
- Clear next steps after every message
- Built-in official Flair links and support channels when self-service or escalation is best
- Context continuity so customers do not need to repeat their issue
- Human handoff with conversation context preserved
- Better handling of high-friction situations:
  - disruptions and delay questions
  - missed-flight follow-up
  - refund and duplicate charge guidance
  - baggage issues
  - accessibility requests

## Customer Experience Principles Used In This Build

- Be efficient: ask only for the next detail needed
- Be clear: show what the agent can do now and what it needs from the customer
- Be trustworthy: use official Flair pages and support channels in the flow
- Be continuous: preserve context across text, voice, and channel continuation
- Be humane: de-escalate frustration and escalate to a person with context when needed

## Current Customer-Facing Experience (Local Build)

- `/support` page with:
  - Text mode
  - Voice mode (browser microphone)
  - Quick actions for common problems
  - Support plan panel (what the agent can do, what it needs)
  - Official Flair support links and sources
  - Continue by phone / SMS with a support reference

## What This Means For Customers

- Faster time to a useful answer
- Less repetition
- More confidence they are following an official Flair channel/path
- Better support continuity when they need a human
